"Princeton Pitch","01/11/2019 13:00","01/11/2019 15:00","Fri","02:00","","Becky Barber","Becky Barber","

Princeton Pitch is an elevator pitch competition co-organized by the Princeton Entrepreneurship Club and Princeton Social Innovation. Students form small teams and are given 90 seconds to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges. Applicants can either submit their idea to the general track or the social track. The social track requires that the idea yield some sort of positive social impact (this can include efforts geared toward sustainability, renewability, social welfare, etc). Prize money is awarded to the top three teams in each track. Princeton Pitch is therefore a competition aimed at providing students with exposure to the pitch process, as well as resources to jumpstart students on their journey in shaping their ideas into tangible products or ventures.
